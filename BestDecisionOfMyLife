>>>> ### __Best Decision Of My Life : STOP PRAYING__ 

>> `Story narrated by a fictional character : SHUBHAM`

>Most of us, come from a humble religious family. By "religious family"
I mean we pray to God, do good by God, FOLLOW and SERVE God, together as a family.
Be it Christmas or Diwali, Good Friday or Janmashtmi, we never miss a chance to
worship the God, any God, all Gods.

>Everyone around us told us to pray when in doubt, to look for good in every situation,
 to be content, be happy, and most importantly to BELIEVE in the God's Grand Plan for us.
 "Everything happens for a reason boy.", they told.

> At first it all seems so surreal and magical to a young novice mind of ours. The thought of
 a supreme being, all powerfull, all eternal and the wisest of all has a plan for us is overwhelming.
 And the concrete to these bricks of our thoughts are the stories we read in the old texts, stories
 told to us by our grand-parents and elders. It is a fascinating world and the child in us loves it,
 trying ever so hard to be a "GOOD" believer.

> But then, something happens, we grow up. Practicality of the world is like a time-bomb,
waiting...for us to step outside. And boy it explods right on our face! It happens to us all,
 we were brought up in controlled environment, never learnt to take or make decisions.
 Incapable of taking control and handle the situation. So, we do what we were taught to do when
we face the odds, PRAY and WORSHIP.
