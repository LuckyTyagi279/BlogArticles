"My program doesn't work, I don't know why.
	My program works! I have no clue why!"

It's 11 o'clock, in the night. He opens the door of his lavish un-furnished
apartment with an amazing view of one old ghostly building 10 feets aways from 
the window of his room.

"You're early tonight.", said his roommate. 

The satire was well understood, but he's too tired to come up with a smart 
come-back. He just smiles back and drops on his bed, still in his jeans and t-shirt.
He notices John is not in the room.

"Where's John?" he asks. 

His room mate (Jack) replied "He's not well, he's in the other room.".

Before Jack could finish, he interrupted, "What happened?". 

"His girl friend dumped him today." said Jack.

"Oh, damn!", he exclaimed. He has plans for the night. He's just got the GOTs6e9 (Game Of
Thrones: Season 6 Episode 9) "Battle of the Bastards". Right there is the dillema which he's
sure is similar to the dilemma faced by Arjuna just before the battle of Kurukshetra began.

"Should I go to John, talk to him, or should I switch on the laptop and pretend I did not hear
what Jack just said to me", he is in a tight situation now.

"Let's go, we'll sit and talk to him.", said Jack.

"I don't know what to say to him man. My words may end up destroying him more", he wants to get out of 
this awkward dillema ASAP.

"But we can't let him drink all alone." Jack argues.

Split second later, he's on his feet, "What is he having?", a bright gleem in his eyes.

"Jack Daniels", pause for a second, "Large", Jack said. A mutual smile was shared between the two. Both
are on the same page and on the way to another room.
